# 🧠 Persona Module – Lifecycle Management System

A comprehensive **lifecycle management system** built during my internship at a startup, this project offers a centralized platform for managing organizational relationships and individual profiles. Developed with a **React.js frontend**, **Node.js backend**, and **PostgreSQL** database, the system streamlines contact management, document handling, organizational mapping, and AI-powered insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Persona Module** acts as the central brain of an organization’s ecosystem, handling:

- 🧑‍💼 **Employees**  
- 🤝 **Vendors**  
- 💼 **Investors**  
- 🗂️ **Documents & Profiles**  
- 📅 **Meetings & Timelines**  
- 🔗 **Relationship Web**  
- 🤖 **AI-based Performance Insights**

Each contact has a dynamic profile with their associated documents, interactions, timelines, and performance analytics — giving CEOs and top-level executives a 360° view of their organizational relationships.
